# Supported releases

## Naja 2.0

The 2.x version of Naja is the latest release and **is fully supported.** It will receive fixes for bugs and security
issues, and new features will be implemented as deemed appropriate.

The 2.x version currently **has NO specified end-of-life date,** and as such will continue to be supported until a new
major release is necessary, in which case the end-of-life window for 2.x will be announced well in advance.


## Naja 1.x

The 1.x version of Naja is **fully supported until September 9, 2020,** which closes the third year since the initial
release of stable 1.0.0. Until this date, Naja will continue to receive fixes for bugs and security issues which will
be released as patches within the last minor version range of 1.8. However, no new features will be implemented in 1.x.

After September 9, 2020, Naja 1.x will NOT receive any further support.
